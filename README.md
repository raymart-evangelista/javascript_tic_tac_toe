# javascript_tic_tac_toe
- completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe) JavaScript curriculum

- the purpose of this project is to work with objects and familiarizing myself with factory functions and modules in JavaScript, with the goal of having as little global code as possible

# todo
- refactor JS code (noticed spots where variables can be scoped better, still some commented code that can be removed)
